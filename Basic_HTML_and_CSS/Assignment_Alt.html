		<h6>Uses of trunk</h6>
		<p>Here is some information about how elephants use their trunks from <i>Elephant Aid International</i>:</p>

		Like the human tongue, the trunk is a muscular hydrostatâ€”a muscle or muscle group that works independently, without bone support. Trunks have incredible strength, flexibility, 
		and dexterity, all properties of muscular hydrostats. Elephants use their trunks to smell, touch, grasp, create sounds, socialize, collect water for drinking, select and 
		manipulate food for eating, and breath, including using their trunk as a snorkel when their bodies are underwater.
